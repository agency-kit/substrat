# Welcome to Substrat

Smart CSS, wrapped in modular (Vue) components, built for SSG. 
Powered by Open-props.

ðŸš§ Under Construction, Follows Semver, current: 0.1.1, lock version and USE WITH CAUTION ðŸš§

## Goals

Produce an overrideable, themable stylesheet that allows use of:
- css custom props,
- total responsiveness at the component and layout level
- semantic HTML
- dark mode, css themes, and dynamic (end-user driven) themes 
- atomic and molecular designs
- include some basic layouts, encourage community driven layouts (and components)
- SSR/SSG Ready
- noJS mode
- tree shakeable components
- easy component aliasing (ex: grid -> mySpecialProductGrid)
- export all component styles as standalone utility stylesheet

## Future

- use Mitosis to output omni-framework compatibile components.
