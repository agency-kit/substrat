# Welcome to Substrat

A functional component based collection of vue components built on CUBE css methodology (Andy Bell) and Every Layout (Heydon).

## Goals and Goodies

produce an overrideable, themable stylesheet that allows use of:
- css custom props,
- unocss utility classes, 
- total responsiveness at the layout and component level
- semantic HTML
- css themes and dynamic themes 
- dark mode (and other color themeable modes using @substrat/chromajs)
- output webcomponent versions of each
- atomic and molecular designs
- provides some basic layouts for use with `vite-plugin-vue-layouts` as a bonus
- SSR/SSG Ready
- tree shakeable components
- easy component aliasing (ex: grid -> productGrid)


## Future Goodies

- Random Image pool application (sets background images around the site based on a pool)
  - randomize and set actions
